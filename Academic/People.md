  > My research is in the theory of distributed computing.
  I particularly like proving lower bounds on the complexity of concrete problems
  with the goal of understanding how parameters of various models of computation affect their computational power.
  I also study data structures in distributed and sequential models.

  > My research interest are programming models to program distributed, parallel,
    or concurrent or systems conveniently, efficiently, and correctly.
