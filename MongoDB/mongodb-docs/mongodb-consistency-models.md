## General Consistency Models
- [Consistency Models @ jepsen.io](https://jepsen.io/consistency#fn-1)

> Jepsen analyses the safety properties of distributed systemsâ€“most notably, 
identifying violations of consistency models.
But what are consistency models? 
What phenomena do they allow? 
What kind of consistency does a given program really need?
In this reference guide, we provide basic definitions, intuitive explanations, 
and theoretical underpinnings of various consistency models for engineers and academics alike.
