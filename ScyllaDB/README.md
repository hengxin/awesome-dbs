# ScyllaDB
- [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/)
  > We built our NoSQL database with a close-to-the-hardware, shared-nothing approach
    that optimizes raw performance, fully utilizes modern multi-core servers
	and minimizes the overhead to DevOps.
	Scylla is API-compatible with both Cassandra and DynamoDB,
	yet is much faster, more consistent and with a lower TCO.
